new failing:  WindowAllowResize settings option                                 11 Oct
last working: Window changed all references of windowSize to surfaceSize        11 Oct


Failing on:
  Window is a IEventListener, receive surface size changed event from Engine
    Commenting out this line fixes it
      Line 189: json { windowEvent.data1, windowEvent.data2 }
